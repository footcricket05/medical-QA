Given the timing around my period, I’m wondering if this could be hormonal or due to a deficiency, especially since managing hydration, diet hasn’t helped. I’d like to know if testing for hormonal imbalances or deficiencies could provide insights, and if certain vitamins or minerals could help with these symptoms.

Androgenetic alopecia,"Hi doctors,
I'm a 19 year old male diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia, currently at Norwood 2. I've been using 2% minoxidil as per my local dermatologist's recommendation, but they haven’t advised starting finasteride. I’m really concerned as hair loss is having a huge impact on my confidence and well being.
I’m considering other options and wondering if I could start with topical finasteride to see how it works before moving to oral finasteride. Would a microdose of oral finasteride be effective, or could it reduce the chances of side effects? Any other recommendations or treatments you’d suggest for my stage would be really helpful.

Mood Swings and behavioural issues,"Hello Doctor 

I am seeking guidance regarding my 70-year-old father, a retired government servant, who has shown noticeable changes in his behaviour since his retirement. He often seems disinterested in family conversations, preferring to look at his mobile instead. He rarely follows any suggestions from family members but tends to listen and act on advice from outsiders, even strangers. 

Additionally, he frequently seeks reasons to leave the house and spends considerable time outside. At family dinners in restaurants , he finishes his meal quickly and engages more with the hotel staff than with us. Despite a stress-free life and a supportive family, we are unsure about the cause of these behavioural changes and would appreciate any insights or recommendations.

Thank in advance you for your help.",Psychiatrist,1555936,M,68

I don’t smoke before or after meals, and I maintain a BP range of around 120-130/90 with a fasting blood sugar level of approximately 105. My height is 170 cm, and my weight fluctuates between 87-88 kg.

This issue has persisted for several years now. Several doctors have suggested I take probiotics, which I’ve adhered to for several weeks at a time, yet my symptoms remain unchanged.

Could you please help me understand what might be causing this persistent bloating? I would also appreciate it if you could suggest any other treatments or medications that might help alleviate this condition.",Gastroenterologist,1555817,M,55

I’ve struggled with weight loss for most of my life, trying various diets, exercise, and lifestyle changes without lasting success. Temporary progress is often followed by regain, affecting my physical health and overall well-being.

Patient have multiple health issues.,"Dear Doctors,
I am writing to seek medical assistance for my uncle, who had a kidney transplant in January 2024. He developed gangrene in the big toe of his left foot, and despite undergoing angioplasty for artery blockage, the toe did not improve and had to be amputated. Unfortunately, the area continued to appear black, which led to a second and then a third amputation that removed 40% of his foot.Now again doctor suggesting for another amputation .
The doctors have assured us that blood flow is present, but the tissue remains black, which they attribute to the steroid medications he is taking following his kidney transplant. We are very concerned about his condition and would appreciate any guidance or further recommendations for treatment.
For additional context, my uncle had a heart stent procedure in March 2023 and had his gallbladder removed in November 2020.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Good core companies require good CPI and very few allow active backlogs.Hence I started to focus on GATE preparation for the PSUs (govt. Jobs) or MTech in good IITs . But here in my IIT, no one cares about or prepare for the GATE exam. Everyone is focussed on the placements. I feel lonely and depressed hearing people around me talking about their performance in various  placements tests. No one really talks to me as I am not of their interest.

SGOT LEVEL INCREASING,"Dear Doctor,
Following my recent full-body checkup a month ago, I was diagnosed with abnormalities in my liver function tests (LFT) and Grade-1 Fatty Liver on the USG of my lower abdomen. After doc consultation, I began taking Tab. Udiliv 300 mg twice daily and Tab. Rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily, as advised.
Upon re-evaluation one month later, I noticed a gradual decrease in most of my liver function parameters. However, my SGOT levels have not decreased and remain elevated. During this period, I have also incorporated lifestyle changes, such as starting gymnastics, which is a new physical activity for me. Additionally, I have been taking Tab. Femilon for the last six months.
Given the persistent elevation in SGOT levels despite improvements in other parameters, I wanted to ask:
Could the SGOT elevation be related to my new physical activity?
Is it possible that Femilon or other medications are contributing to the elevated SGOT or impacting my liver function?",Gastroenterology,1553499,F,29

My last hiv test was on 14th of this month and the hiv index value was 0.09 non reactive. And I tested negative for hepatitis a b c and Chlamydia, and syphilis.

I got a cold sore that went away after a few days. And currently have no outbreaks. But this index value, my God. Does this also mean that I might have HSVE (encephalitis)?

Request for Guidance on Transitioning fr,"Hi doctor, A few years ago, I consulted a cardiologist after my brother passed away due to heart enlargement. During that consultation, I was prescribed Proloment R 50 as a precautionary measure, and I have been taking it regularly since then.

After conducting a thorough examination and running all necessary tests, he confirmed that everything appears fine with my heart health. He has recommended that I switch to Telsma 40 (Telmisartan) for managing my blood pressure instead of continuing with Proloment R 50.
I would like your guidance on how to safely transition from the beta blocker to Telsma 40. I understand that tapering beta blockers is necessary to avoid complications and would appreciate your advice on the best approach to do this.

Severe acne issue on face,"I need your help since dermatologists where I live haven't been attentive, and following their advice led to stubborn acne. It started when I sought a solution for clear, 'glass' skin to treat mild acne. The dermatologist recommended a 0.025% tretinoin cream. I used it once a week with the 'sandwich' method and her suggested moisturizer. After a few days, I experienced severe purging on my cheeks and jawline. I knew the purging would happen but It continued for weeks, and I thought I might be doing something wrong, so I researched and realized I might be too young (I was 20) or my skin was too sensitive for tretinoin. I stopped using it, but my acne worsened. I tried a vitamin C face wash and later added a salicylic acid face wash(on alternate days), but it caused more purging. Now, I only use a basic face wash (patanjali face wash), but I still have active acne and marks on my cheeks, jawline, and neck.

Indigestion-Sudden Anxiety and Weakness,"Last week, during a severe indigestion episode, I suddenly felt extreme anxiety, shivering, dizziness and overall weakness. This was a particularly distressing experience.
	•	Since then, I’ve noticed that when I engage in intense physical activities or workouts, I sometimes feel the onset of similar anxiety-like symptoms, though they go away once I stop and rest.

Steps I’ve Taken:

I’ve made significant lifestyle changes over the past 2 months to try to alleviate these symptoms:

	•	Quit smoking and alcohol completely.
	•	Stopped eating outside food and have been sticking to home-cooked, low-fat meals.
	•	Drinking warm water regularly and have limited caffeine intake.
	•	Exercising regularly and maintaining an active lifestyle.

Update: The indigestion seems to be cured but this anxiety and weakness episodes are recurring but have reduced.

I’ve had a full-body checkup and a full abdomen ultrasound, and the reports didn’t show any alarming issues. Please advise.",Gastroenterologist,1550517,M,27

Request for Guidance on Transitioning fr,"Dear Doctor,
A 3 years ago, I consulted a cardiologist after my brother passed away due to heart enlargement. During that consultation, I was prescribed Proloment R 50 as a precautionary measure, and I have been taking it regularly since then.
Recently, I sought a second opinion from an international electrophysiologist. After conducting a thorough examination and running all necessary tests, he confirmed that everything appears fine with my heart health. He has recommended that I switch to Telsma 40 (Telmisartan) for managing my blood pressure instead of continuing with Proloment R 50.
I would like your guidance on how to safely transition from the beta blocker to Telsma 40. I understand that tapering beta blockers is necessary to avoid complications and would appreciate your advice on the best approach to do this.
Thank you.",Cardiologist,1550329,M,21

Later I consulted dentist , who confirmed there was not much high point. However he just etched few part of cap and polished it to just remove minor high point.

Am I taking PEP unnecessarily?,"Second opinion needed: Last month on 18/09/2024 at 07:25 PM I made the stupid decision of having unprotected sex with 2 shady sex workers.

During the deed my penis would have been 2 inches erect at max and I'm pretty sure MY PENIS DID NOT ENTER HER VAGINA. I DID NOT FEEL MY PENIS ENTERING HER VAGINA but somehow my penis felt some friction and I came within 2 or 3 minutes. I guess it must have been her pussy lips.
For the second sex worker, I kissed her in the same no tongues involved way and I performed fellatio on her (pussy licking) and I asked her to perform oral sex (blowjob) on my uncircumcised penis without a condom.

Anxiety about exposure,"Male 33 , height 160 cm, weight 65 kg
Yesterday I was accidentally walked under a tree with bats eating fruits. So a bat dropped a hard fruit it was eating and it landed on my head and into the ground. On ground I saw that the fruit was bitten by bat, it must have scared due to me walking underneath. 
Now I'm afraid whether this is a legit exposure as the bat salaiva must be on the fruit and while it hit my head, the salaiva can splash and what if it has fallen on my eyes or lips ? ( I did not feel anything but I'm afraid of tiny micro drops of salaiva that may have splashed from the impact that fruit had on my head( it may be so small that I may not have felt the tiny droplets that have landed on eye/ lip ))
Is this a legit concern or overthinking? I can't do anything else other than thinking about this ... Should I go on with my life or should be concerned !!!?? Please please help I'm terrified",General Physician,1548054,M,32

Since my phone was getting repaired, I used my son's account. And I asked a proper question to a reply that if it's 6 months you should take TT, when it's wrong if you have taken a primary series you are covered till 5 years atleast for a small cut from a trimmer  that even didn't draw blood. I did ultimately consult a friend who works at Medanta and now am satisfied with his reply. Thank you.",General Physician,1547388,M,18

Treatment for Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Hello doctors,
My 79 yo father has recently been diagnosed with Abdominal aortic aneurysm. The diameter of the aorta is 5.9*5.8 cm. His cholesterol level is in range. 
The doctor has suggested minimal invasive surgery to insert a stent to rectify the situation.
Are there any alternative ways of treatment like Ayurveda or Homeopathy available to treat this situation, considering the age of my father and the size of the aorta. Will it be risky if we go with Ayurveda or Allopathy as these medications take time to cure.
Also if we go for the surgery, what chances are there to not get it back and complete healing. 
Thankyou.",Cardiologist,1547115,M,79

Concern Regarding Rising PSA Levels Post,"**Brief:**
My father was diagnosed with cancer in 2018 and has been undergoing treatment since. He was on bicalutamide for three years, which effectively controlled his PSA levels until 2021. After that, he was switched to enzalutamide, which worked well until 2024, when his PSA levels began rising again. Recently, apalutamide was administered for three weeks, but his PSA levels continued to rise. Chemotherapy was then started, with docetaxel 80 mg in 21-day cycles. However, despite three chemotherapy sessions, his PSA levels have increased from 16  to 122 . 
**Question:**  
Given that my father’s PSA levels continue to rise despite chemotherapy, are there any alternative treatments or options we can consider at this point? What might be causing the PSA levels to keep increasing despite the ongoing treatment? My father is 60 years old, and we are concerned about the effectiveness of the current treatment plan. 
Thanks",Oncologist,1547104,M,60

Suffering from burning sensation in legs,"I took Himalaya Mind Alert tablets from 2015 to 2017, during this time I got cataracts. My doctor suggested that these tablets contributed to the cataracts, so I stopped using them.

I've visited multiple hospitals and undergone various tests (blood tests, sugar tests, nerve tests, etc.), all of which came back normal. However, I do have deficiencies in vitamin B12 and vitamin D. Despite receiving B12 injections and taking supplements, my levels haven't increased.
My symptoms include burning sensation in legs, pimples on my scalp, fatigue, and dry eyes.

Anxiety symptoms,"""I've been taking anxiety medication since 2016. I took it for three years, then stopped for one year using my willpower. However, around Diwali in 2023, I started experiencing anxiety again—panic attacks, dizziness, a fast heartbeat, etc. I consulted my doctor and started taking Dfax 100 mg. After six months, I reduced the dose to 50 mg, and since April this year, I've been on 25 mg.
For the past month, I've also started going to the gym. But for the last three days, I've been feeling cold sweats at times, along with occasional fatigue. I'm not mentally panicking or anything, and overall, I feel much better compared to how I used to feel. However, these cold sweats (feeling cold when touching my skin while sweating) concern me.

From today morning he was coughing occasionally but no running nose. So in evening we applied Ghee & Camphor again on his chest. But now (more than 24 hrs from his fall) he vomited complete milk. Along with it lot of mucus came out. He had to apply lot of pressure to let mucus out. Immediately he vomited 2-3 times in which only mucus came out now.
