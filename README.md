# 🩺 Medical QA Project  

This project is a **Medical Question Answering System**, designed to provide users with **informative and ethical responses** to medical questions. It includes both a **backend** (FastAPI-based API) and a **frontend** (ReactJS-based web application) for a seamless user experience.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🧠 **Medical Expertise Simulation**:  
  - Classifies medical questions into relevant specialties.  
  - Generates grounded answers based on symptoms, lifestyle, and suggested remedies.  
- 🤝 **Ethical Compliance**:  
  - Does not prescribe medications or treatments.  
  - Encourages consulting healthcare professionals for medical advice.  
- 🚀 **Easy Deployment**:  
  - Backend API and frontend are containerized using **Docker**.  
  - Fully orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for seamless deployment.  
- 🌐 **Frontend Hosting**:  
  - The frontend is hosted on **Netlify**, enabling easy access to users.  
- 💻 **Local Deployment**:  
  - Backend runs efficiently on standard hardware, with no need for GPUs.

## ✅ Prerequisites  

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:  

1. 🐳 **Docker**: For containerizing and running the backend and frontend.  
2. 📦 **Docker Compose**: To orchestrate multi-container applications.  
3. 🌍 **ngrok** (optional): For exposing local backend to the internet during testing.  
4. 🟢 **Node.js** (v16 or above): For frontend development.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation  

### 1. 🛠️ Clone the Repository  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/footcricket05/medical-QA.git  
cd medical-QA  
```  

### 2. 📥 Download the Trained Model  

The `model.safetensors` file is not included in this repository due to its size. Download the trained model file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PgTasOUeE2AMugYG7zI1h7sygAOvfMRv?usp=sharing).  

1. Download the file from the provided Google Drive link.  
2. Save the `model.safetensors` file in the `model` folder:  
   ```plaintext  
   medical-QA/  
   └── model/  
       └── model.safetensors  
   ```  

---

### 🐳 Dockerized Setup  

#### 1. 🔨 Build and Start the Project  

Use Docker Compose to build and run both backend and frontend services:  

```bash  
docker-compose up --build  
```  

- The **backend** will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.  
- The **frontend** will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.  

---

#### 2. 🌍 Expose Backend Locally (Optional)  

To access the backend from a public device (like a mobile phone):  

1. Start `ngrok`:  
   ```bash  
   ngrok http 8000  
   ```  
2. Use the public URL provided by `ngrok` to replace the backend URL in the frontend (`medical-qa-frontend/src/App.js`).  

---

### 🖥️ Manual Setup  

If you prefer running the project without Docker:  

#### 1. 🧩 Backend Setup

   cd src  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Start the FastAPI server:  
   ```bash  
   uvicorn app.combined_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload  
   ```  

#### 2. 🌐 Frontend Setup
